# Learing_Exercises
Here you can find some exercises that I have run during my learning process. As a manager, understanding code allows me to become more empathic with developers' teams and gives me a big picture of technology creation. I have the chance to be close to innovation with strong ideas and valid properties.
I have been involved in Python, JavaScript, HTML, R and SQL. I am not a full-stack developer, my abilities are mainly focused on management, business and marketing; however, I enjoy being immersed in coding as an IT leader. Besides, this knowledge allows me to take advantage of automatization, queries and find solutions.
